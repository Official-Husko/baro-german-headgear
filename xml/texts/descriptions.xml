    Issued from the ckl works in mid-1944, this size 64 shell carries the lot number 2979. 
    Its Normandy camouflage was brushed on hastily, earthy greens and browns breaking up the outline beneath the hedgerows. 
    Mud still clings in the rim’s recesses, as if set down in a foxhole after a summer storm. 
    Some say it was left where its wearer fell, the liner stiffened by time, the steel carrying the silence of the bocage where battles raged and ended in whispers.
